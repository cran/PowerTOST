Version 0.8-1 
released 2010-11-25
     - helper function CVfromCI() added to estimate the CV from a confidence  
       interval. Useful if no CV but CI was given in literature.

Version 0.7-3 
released 2010-10-09
     - bugs in documentation removed
     - input argument diff removed from sampleN.TOST, expsampleN.TOST,
       power.TOST and exppower.TOST
Version 0.7-2 
released 2010-08-27
     - little bug causing warnings in case of 2x2 alias 2x2x2 removed
Version 0.7-1 
released 2010-08-12
     - functions added for the power and sample size for the ratio of 
       two means with normally distributed data on the original scale 
       (based on Fieller's confidence (fiducial) interval).
       AFAIK until now only implemented in the commercial nQuery.
     - Note that the parameter diff (Null ratio / Null diff.) is now
       named theta0 since it was annoying for users to call it diff in case
       of ratios (logscale=TRUE). The parameter diff is still supported
       but will be ceased in the next release. Therefore a warning is issued 
       if diff is used.
       
Version 0.6-2 
released 2010-07-21
     - some internal code consolidation
     - internal hidden functions .CV2se() and .se2CV() made public
     - minor enhancements in help pages 
     - more examples
     - short documentation of used statistical apparatus
       BE_power_sample_size_excerpt.pdf
       for classical power / sample size in directory /doc added

Version 0.5-1 
     - first release to CRAN on 2010-05-07
