Version 1.1-03
Released 2012-05-03
     - Flaw in implementing the sims of 2x3x3 design with different intra-subject
       variabilities in functions power.RSABE() and sampleN.RSABE() as well as
       in functions power.scABEL() and sampleN.scABEL() disposed.
     - Methods and implementation details of the simulations for scaled ABE 
       documented in a PDF file in the /doc subdirectory of the package.
     - Simulation method for the EMA scaled ABEL changed to conform better
       with power values from simulations via subject data.  
     - Warning section in the help file of power.scABEL() introduced to
       appoint the fact that simulations via subject data and via the
       methods implemented in power.scABEL() gave empirical power values
       that are only approximately in agreement.   
Version 1.1-02
Released 2012-02-28
     - Functions power.RSABE() and sampleN.RSABE() introduced to calculate
       power and sample size for the BE decision via linearized scaled 
       ABE criterion as favored method of the FDA. Power and sample size
       are based on simulations.
     - Default of nsims changed to 1E5 (suggested by Helmut Schuetz).
     - Argument setseed introduced in the scaled ABE functions to avoid 
       different outcomes depending on the state of the (pseudo) random
       number generator. If setseed=TRUE a set.seed(123456) is issued before
       each call of the simulation functions.
     - Documentation improved.
Version 1.1-00
Released 2012-02-08
     - Functions power.scABEL() and sampleN.scABEL() introduced to calculate
       power and sample size for the BE decision via scaled (widened)
       BE acceptance limits based on simulations.
       Thanks to Helmut Schuetz for power testing these functions.

     - False News file included. Sorry for that.
Version 1.0-01
not released, integrated in 1.1-00
     - Upper one-sided CL of the CV and therefore argument alpha2 removed from
       expsampleN.noninf() and expsampleN.TOST() because it lead to some
       confusion in users thinking this had to do with the algorithm via
       expected power.
     - CI2CV() as alias to CVfromCI() introduced because my self always typed 
       this name if aimed to calculate the CV from a given CI.
     - Function CVCL() now returns a 2 element vector also if an one sided
       interval is requested.   
Version 1.0-00
Released 2012-10-26
     - Bugfix in power.noninf() to get the correct power if theta0 is below
       margin (if margin <1) or theta0 is above margin (if margin >1).
       power.noninf() calculated up to now the power of an inferiority test.
       Thanks to Helmut Schuetz.
     - New helper functions CV2mse() and mse2CV.
     - New function CVCI() to calculate a confidence interval of a CV.   
Version 0.9-11
Released 2012-08-07
     - Bug fix in power.TOST(),  power2.TOST() and power.noninf() to use the 
       right df depending on argument robust. robust=FALSE had used the 
       robust df's. Thanks to Ben.
Version 0.9-10
Released 2012-07-20
     - Bug-fix in internal function .Q.integrand()
     - Bug fix in nmin - must be a multiple of steps to assure balance
       in sequence groups.
       Again thanks to Helmut Schuetz for detecting both.
Version 0.9-9
Released 2012-07-18
     - Workaround introduced to handle numeric problems in integrate()
       if CV<5.3E-6. Thanks to Helmut Schuetz.
     - Minimum sample size adapted to design used (f.i. n=2 if design="paired")  
Version 0.9-8
Released 2012-04-05 (Easter egg)
     - Functions added for 'expected' power and sample size calculations based 
       on it for the non-inferiority test for sake of completeness.
     - Functions CVpooled(), exppower.TOST() and expsampleN.TOST() now
       also implemented for logscale=FALSE, i.e. contain that argument in 
       their calls.
     - Function OwensQOwen() made public. This is an implementation of the 
       algorithm given by Owen itself in the original paper (Biometrica 1965) 
       via repeated integration by parts. 
       This function is only for comparative purposes.
     - Function OwensT() made public. It is needed internal in OwensQOwen()
       but may be useful for other purposes.   
Version 0.9-6/7
Released 2012-03-26
     - version 0.9-7 is a small bug fix version required from CRAN. 
       Contains the old version number 0.9-6 in the package man page.
     - Functions added for power and sample size calculations based on 
       non-inferiority t-test. This is not a TOST procedure but eventually 
       useful if the question of 'non-superiority' within a BE study must be 
       evaluated.
       Hint: Evaluation of Fluctuation in the EMA MR NfG (1999) between 
       modified release formulation and immediate release product.
Version 0.9-4
Released 2012-03-05
     - Little bug in sampleN.TOST removed which causes extra doubled output
       of n and power if n=4. Thanks to Ben:
       http://forum.bebac.at/mix_entry.php?id=8206
Version 0.9-3
Released 2012-02-13
     - Bug in power.TOST removed which prevented calculation of Power
       according to method ^= "exact".
     - Sample size tables for replicate design 2x2x3 in data sub-directory added.
     - Sample size tables for replicate design 2x4x4 in data sub-directory added.
     - Scripts in the /test sub-directory made available.
Version 0.9-2
released 2011-12-24
     - Function power2.TOST() added to allow power calculations for 
       studies with unbalanced (sequence) groups.
     - Argument exact replaced by method in power.TOST(), sampleN.TOST().
       See help for these functions.
     - Attention! The sample size for the parallel group design is now
       the TOTAL sample size (to be consistent across all functions).
     - Sample size tables added for the 2x2 crossover and for the parallel 
       group design to alleviate validation/qualification of the package. 
       See data(package="PowerTOST").
     - Scripts added in the \tests sub-directory that create the sample size 
       tables from the data section.
     - Updated BE_power_sample_size_excerpt.pdf in the doc sub-directory.
Version 0.9-0
released 2011-12-15
     - Paired means design introduced
     - 'robust' argument added to nearly all functions.
       With robust=TRUE the degrees of freedom for the so-called robust
       evaluation (df2 in known.designs() output) will be used. 
       This may be helpful if planning is done for higher order designs 
       evaluated via mixed model or via intra-subject contrasts 
       (aka Senn's basic estimator).
     - Due to the necessary NAMESPACE from R14.0 on the internal functions 
       (names starting with .) are no longer exported.
Version 0.8-7
released 2011-10-20
     - Problem with slash in \name field of manual resolved 
       (requested by B. Ripley)
Version 0.8-6 
released 2011-05-18
     - Bug removed which gave incorrect exact power values in case of
       alpha>=0.5 (very unusual setting). Thanks again to Craig Zupke.
       Cross checked results of power at equivalence margins against 
       SAS Proc Power.
Version 0.8-5 
released 2011-05-16
     - Code in Owen's Q adapted to account for large delta or large b
       leading to integrand function almost zero over the whole range
       which then gave an error in integrate(). Thanks to Craig Zupke.
Version 0.8-4 
released 2011-03-11
     - Number of maximal steps in sample size search in the sample size 
       functions, formerly hard coded as 50, made accessible to users via 
       argument imax. but needs only adapted in rare extremal cases.
     - Start value for sample size search improved around theta0=1 (logscale)
       or theta0=0 (untransformed).
Version 0.8-3 
released 2011-01-18
     - Bug fix in known.designs().
Version 0.8-2 
released 2011-01-10
     - error in df for 3x3 and 4x4 crossover removed
     - function for pooling CV's from different studies made public
       see ?CVpooled
Version 0.8-1 
released 2010-11-25
     - helper function CVfromCI() added to estimate the CV from a confidence  
       interval. Useful if no CV but CI was given in literature.

Version 0.7-3 
released 2010-10-09
     - bugs in documentation removed
     - input argument diff removed from sampleN.TOST, expsampleN.TOST,
       power.TOST and exppower.TOST
Version 0.7-2 
released 2010-08-27
     - little bug causing warnings in case of 2x2 alias 2x2x2 removed
Version 0.7-1 
released 2010-08-12
     - functions added for the power and sample size for the ratio of 
       two means with normally distributed data on the original scale 
       (based on Fieller's confidence (fiducial) interval).
       AFAIK until now only implemented in the commercial nQuery.
     - Note that the parameter diff (Null ratio / Null diff.) is now
       named theta0 since it was annoying for users to call it diff in case
       of ratios (logscale=TRUE). The parameter diff is still supported
       but will be ceased in the next release. Therefore a warning is issued 
       if diff is used.
       
Version 0.6-2 
released 2010-07-21
     - some internal code consolidation
     - internal hidden functions .CV2se() and .se2CV() made public
     - minor enhancements in help pages 
     - more examples
     - short documentation of used statistical apparatus
       BE_power_sample_size_excerpt.pdf
       for classical power / sample size in directory /doc added

Version 0.5-1 
     - first release to CRAN on 2010-05-07
