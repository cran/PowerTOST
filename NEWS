Version 0.9-3
Released 2012-02-13
     - Bug in power.TOST removed which prevented calculation of Power
       according to method ^= "exact".
     - Sample size tables for replicate design 2x2x3 in data sub-directory added.
     - Sample size tables for replicate design 2x4x4 in data sub-directory added.
     - Scripts in the /test sub-directory made available.
Version 0.9-2
released 2011-12-24
     - Function power2.TOST() added to allow power calculations for 
       studies with unbalanced (sequence) groups.
     - Argument exact replaced by method in power.TOST(), sampleN.TOST().
       See help for these functions.
     - Attention! The sample size for the parallel group design is now
       the TOTAL sample size (to be consistent across all functions).
     - Sample size tables added for the 2x2 crossover and for the parallel 
       group design to alleviate validation/qualification of the package. 
       See data(package="PowerTOST").
     - Scripts added in the \tests sub-directory that create the sample size 
       tables from the data section.
     - Updated BE_power_sample_size_excerpt.pdf in the doc sub-directory.
Version 0.9-0
released 2011-12-15
     - Paired means design introduced
     - 'robust' argument added to nearly all functions.
       With robust=TRUE the degrees of freedom for the so-called robust
       evaluation (df2 in known.designs() output) will be used. 
       This may be helpful if planning is done for higher order designs 
       evaluated via mixed model or via intra-subject contrasts 
       (aka Senn's basic estimator).
     - Due to the necessary NAMESPACE from R14.0 on the internal functions 
       (names starting with .) are no longer exported.
Version 0.8-7
released 2011-10-20
     - Problem with slash in \name field of manual resolved 
       (requested by B. Ripley)
Version 0.8-6 
released 2011-05-18
     - Bug removed which gave incorrect exact power values in case of
       alpha>=0.5 (very unusual setting). Thanks again to Craig Zupke.
       Cross checked results of power at equivalence margins against 
       SAS Proc Power.
Version 0.8-5 
released 2011-05-16
     - code in Owen's Q adapted to account for large delta or large b
       leading to integrand function almost zero over the whole range
       which then gave an error in integrate(). Thanks to Craig Zupke.
Version 0.8-4 
released 2011-03-11
     - number of maximal steps in sample size search in the sample size 
       functions, formerly hard coded as 50, made accessible to users via 
       argument imax. but needs only adapted in rare extremal cases
     - start value for sample size search improved around theta0=1 (logscale)
       or theta0=0 (untransformed)
Version 0.8-3 
released 2011-01-18
     - bug fix in known.designs
Version 0.8-2 
released 2011-01-10
     - error in df for 3x3 and 4x4 crossover removed
     - function for pooling CV's from different studies made public
       see ?CVpooled
Version 0.8-1 
released 2010-11-25
     - helper function CVfromCI() added to estimate the CV from a confidence  
       interval. Useful if no CV but CI was given in literature.

Version 0.7-3 
released 2010-10-09
     - bugs in documentation removed
     - input argument diff removed from sampleN.TOST, expsampleN.TOST,
       power.TOST and exppower.TOST
Version 0.7-2 
released 2010-08-27
     - little bug causing warnings in case of 2x2 alias 2x2x2 removed
Version 0.7-1 
released 2010-08-12
     - functions added for the power and sample size for the ratio of 
       two means with normally distributed data on the original scale 
       (based on Fieller's confidence (fiducial) interval).
       AFAIK until now only implemented in the commercial nQuery.
     - Note that the parameter diff (Null ratio / Null diff.) is now
       named theta0 since it was annoying for users to call it diff in case
       of ratios (logscale=TRUE). The parameter diff is still supported
       but will be ceased in the next release. Therefore a warning is issued 
       if diff is used.
       
Version 0.6-2 
released 2010-07-21
     - some internal code consolidation
     - internal hidden functions .CV2se() and .se2CV() made public
     - minor enhancements in help pages 
     - more examples
     - short documentation of used statistical apparatus
       BE_power_sample_size_excerpt.pdf
       for classical power / sample size in directory /doc added

Version 0.5-1 
     - first release to CRAN on 2010-05-07
